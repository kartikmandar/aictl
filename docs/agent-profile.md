# Agent Profile Format

Agent profiles are markdown files with YAML frontmatter that define an agent's behavior and configuration.

## Structure

```markdown
---
name: agent-name
description: Brief description of the agent
# Optional configuration fields
---

# System prompt content

The markdown content becomes the agent's system prompt.
Define the agent's role, responsibilities, and behavior here.
```

## Required Fields

- `name` (string): Unique identifier for the agent
- `description` (string): Brief description of the agent's purpose

## Optional Fields

- `mcpServers` (object): MCP server configurations for additional tools
- `tools` (array): List of allowed tools, use `["*"]` for all
- `allowedTools` (array): Whitelist of tools (e.g., `["@builtin", "@aictl-mcp-server"]`)
- `toolAliases` (object): Map tool names to aliases
- `toolsSettings` (object): Tool-specific configuration
- `model` (string): AI model to use
- `prompt` (string): Additional prompt text

## Example
